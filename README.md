How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
- Service workers are related to graceful degradation because they allow newer versions of a web app (like having internet) to have the best experiences while older versions (browsers without internet) to still have core functionalities of the same web app.  We were still able to see the recipe cards while being offline.  We create a fallback experience with service workers and thus are following the principles of graceful degradation.
